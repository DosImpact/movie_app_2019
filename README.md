- why react.js
거의 모든회사가 react.js를 사용한다. 페이스북이 만들고 있고, 많은 돈과 사람이 투자된다.  
기술 플젝에 많은 돈과 커뮤니티가 있다.  
리액트는 자바스크립트이므로 리액트가 없어진다 하더라고 수준높은 js개발자가 되 있을것이다.  


- Webpack, Babel
react을 이용해서 아름답고 섹시한 웹를 만들수 있으나, 몇몇 멍청한 브라우저떄문에 이를 어리석은 코드로 바꿔주어야 한다.  
하지만 이 단계를 생략한다.  
```c
npx create-react-app moive_app_2019
npm start
```

# Movie App 2019

React Js Fundamentals Course (2019 Update!)






This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
